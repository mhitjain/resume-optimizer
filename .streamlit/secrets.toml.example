# Streamlit Cloud Secrets Configuration
# 
# When deploying to Streamlit Cloud:
# 1. Go to your app settings
# 2. Click on "Secrets" in the sidebar
# 3. Add this content (with your actual password)
#
# Note: Users will provide their own API keys via the UI,
# so you don't need to set GROQ_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY here.

# Required: Password for encrypting cookies (use a strong random string)
COOKIES_PASSWORD = "your-secure-random-password-here-min-32-chars"

# Optional: If you want to suppress gRPC warnings
GRPC_VERBOSITY = "ERROR"
GLOG_minloglevel = "2"
